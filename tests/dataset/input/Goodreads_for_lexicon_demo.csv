 This book is about the devastating effect this recession had on the everyday people of a small town. 
 The story is told by numerous narrators all who speak with their own voice. The Irish dialect is present as is the slang and yes the swearing. I don't think I've ever read a book written in such a 'human way' 
 The book due to some of the subject matter is quite dark and depressing but there is humour here too, the sense of place is vivid , the characters real. 
 This book was long listed for the Man Booker prize .. I'm so glad it didn't win or I might never have read it. ;)"

He shoos the bee away, but it's a persistent creature, and lands on the banana again. When he almost swallows the bee, the monkey becomes enraged and chases him. Intent on swatting that bee, he ends up bothering a lion who gives chase to him. Strangely enough, the bee turns out to be a very good friend to the monkey, saving him from the lion. The book's humor, small amount of text, and colorful illustrations will entice readers to read this one repeatedly. Who knew that a monkey and a bee could get along so well?

Much, if not most of this volume takes place off the reservation and in D.C. I tend to read these for the descriptions of reservation life, and this was a bit of a letdown for me as much of it was about South American political factions harming each other in the US, with an interesting sidestory regarding Amtrak operations ... While I appreciated the tribal history this one described, I like Hillerman's feel for the West, and that was limited here.

It's a collection of essays, which mostly center on Holm's home town of Minneota, Minnesota and the Icelandic immigrants who settled there. His language is poetic and dense with content. You can't rush through this book. But I enjoyed this quirky combination of memoir, commentary, nostalgia, and cooking, complete with recipes. By the time I finished reading it, I had fallen in love with Bill Holm. On every page, I felt him beside me, fully alive. I just discovered that he passed away in 2009 at age 65 of complications from pneumonia. Nuts.

 When I was a child, I always wondered why there were so many princes and princesses in books and movies and so few in real life. It took me a while to realize that writers were making up countries and entire royal families just so their heroes and heroines could be royalty. I've come to accept it now and hardly bat an eye, but in this book, the author goes a step further and adds a bit of magic and fairy tale to the story. 
 So the hero is a prince from Nvengaria, a sliver of a fictional country embedded somewhere between Austria and Russia, which makes me imagine his accent is a little like Arnold Schwarzenegger's. Now that I think about it, I'm not sure if that's sexy. 
 The heroine, though English-born, is somehow also a Nvengarian princess, descended many, many generations from some line her great-great-grandmother once heard. 
 For the first half of the book, I thought this might be a little like some of Julie Garwood's books, a historical romance where the characters are instantly attracted to each other and the woman is a princess from some little known country. Not quite. There's a prophecy involved in this story, which kind of gives it something a little bit fantastical, and then halfway through the book, a magical creature crashes a party, and all hell breaks loose. 
 I totally wasn't expecting that. 
 From there, it becomes more and more magical and fairy-tale-like, and I suppose I was able to accept that. I liked the story and the characters and the arc of the story, but I must admit that the fantasy elements kind of threw me for a loop because they were introduced so late and so gradually. 
 I loved that the bad guy wasn't all bad -- you got two sides of a coin on that end, such that the book could have been written from the bad guy's point of view, with him being a hero. I really liked that about the book as it's much like real life. 
 Fun read.

 Most of the photos, while styled well, featured bracelets which were slightly curved instead of straight and flat. I'm personally not able to tie the knots with even tension, so mine have always been off. It's nit picky, but perfect samples would've made the book more polished. The cover was meh, which is actually an important photo when trying to attract reader/crafter interest. 
 Favorites were the fish and polka dots. I'm not a fan of wrapped bracelets, but the criss cross pattern was cool and would appeal to boys. Included instructions for adding beads or charms and doing a strand of wrapped hair. Overall, a good pick if you or your kiddo are interested in learning to craft friendship bracelets."

 Archer sexy ex-military a human in a wolf clan, not real happy about the ""traditions"" his mother was trying to push his half brother into mainlty the ""offering"", with a bit of manuvering (smiles) he went himself. 
 Reena sexy and sassy and the most powerful wolf and in the city and most call her Mistress. The Offering is something she dreaded and wanted to change but the council didn't agree. So she found her self having to pick a bed mate for the night. 
 Just a quick fun story, Im all about getting the next book in the novella series. What's in store for Archer and Reena. will it matter that he's human? Grab the next book and find out, I know I am."

It's all about Erik's character: who is his, what's he's done, and what's he's become. The actual fight against the incursion is a bit too decompressed, but still it's a great end to Magneto's current story. [7+/10]. 
 I've long complained about Marvel padding out their volumes with semi-relevant historic stories, and this is no exception, with its inclusion of original X-Men #51-52. However, this is one that I actually read, mainly because of its bright 4-color art of the late days of the original X-Men. And it was a disappointment. The story is largely incoherent because it starts on a cliffhanger and ends on a cliffhanger. In other words, it's a fine example of why Marvel should stop this silliness. 
 Ignoring the reprint, this a good volume."

 Back then, people thought that he (and this book) was the genuine article and this book was actually used as scholarly material by researchers. (Backhouse did know how to speak Chinese, and he obtained and donated many Chinese manuscripts to libraries. However, though much of it was real, some of these materials were fake) While parts of this book are factual (which made it easier for people to accept the rest of the book as real), the stories he spun off are just figments of his perverted imagination. A better book to read is 'Dragon Lady: The Life and Legend of the Last Empress of China' by Sterling Seagrave, which offers a neutral and factual study into Cixi's life and that of the Manchu court. If you read this book, do so only for entertainment purposes."

 Sexy Little Surprises by J.C. Daniels is the emotional erotic tale of a married couple who finally reach a crisis on their tenth anniversary. A myriad of events coalesce into an apparently insurmountable barrier as each partner withdraws further and further from the pain that can only be experienced by those who share a searingly deep connection. Alexis Marshall is familiar with the stresses attendant upon those who have loved ones in hazardous jobs but has somehow lost her equanimity as her husband has become more and more distant over the past couple of years until she wonders whether her marriage can be saved. Garrett Marshall has immersed himself in his job and lost his connection to his wife as he battles his sense of guilt. The shocking realization that he may be about to lose the very woman that he cherishes forces him to re-evaluate the state of his life even as he struggles to comprehend the mysterious gifts that he begins receiving. Open communication is paramount for any healthy relationship and Alexis and Garrett will have to decide if they can find a way to nurse their marriage back to health. 
 A touching and sensual tale that explores the role that guilt plays in our daily lives as well as the importance of sharing openly with one's partner through good and bad times. Each of these emotionally distraught individuals is operating under a misapprehension that leads them to the breaking point in their relationship but must find a way to reach out to each other. The author displays her incredible ability to pen very dramatic crises in a succinct manner while providing a spicy and entertaining read. Keep the tissues handy for this quick but incredibly satisfying read. 
 I was fortunate enough to be provided a copy of this work from the author in exchange for an honest review."

I do know he has a second, very successful career as a well-regarded romance novelist. I've never read any of his novels, romance is not my genre, but this book arrived on my review list and I was curious and thought this story of a widower who decides to make a Grand Tour of Europe after the death of his unadventurous, stay-at-home wife, might be interesting and a little different from my usual reading - which it was, but not in a very entirely satisfying way. It was a smooth and pleasant enough read - not a riveter, I must say, nor any kind of twisty, turny tale. It was - with one small exception - somewhat uneventful, even a little dull. I'm afraid I found it all rather too *nice*. Most of the people (there are a few exceptions but they are not the norm) are so very kind and generous and helpful - either Alan T. leads a very charmed life or he was trying to introduce a lightly magical aspect to his tale. The writing style is a bit overblown and wordy too, and the appallingly written French accented dialogue was both comical and embarrassing and constantly reminded me of the tipsy French lady at Fawlty Towers, 'oh Mizter Fawlty, you are Zo Nautee.' One other thing that bothered me slightly - Mr Gandy seems awfully old for his age. I think I read that he was 52, which is really not very old these days; the upright chap in these pages felt to be nearer eighty at times. In short, there's nothing all to object to here, it was a just a little like munching on a bag of Werther's Originals when what you really fancied was a big bar of very good chocolate with chili. This was rather like what my Mum would always call 'a nice cup of tea', but I'm more of a Bombay Sapphire lass myself. I'm sure Alan's regular readers and many more besides will love it, it just wasn't my particular cup of ruin.

 This is the third bio of AR that I've read in the last two or three months - quite enough for the present, I would say. I find it interesting, however, how differently I read this particular volume. It seems to me at this moment that while I read Robb and Nicholls on AR, I was acquiring information and formulating my own sense of AR and attempting to sketch a trajectory of his life from the bits of evidence and the results of rather inconclusive analyses and interpretations that these biographers presented. As I read Steinmetz, I found myself looking for information, interpretations in his narrative that enhanced, amplified, confirmed, amended, refuted, etc., my ideas of the trajectory of AR's life and the sources of the energy and drive that propelled his life along that trajectory. So it seems to me that I was better prepared to grapple with Steinmetz's account than I had been heretofore. 
 So what did I find? Not very much of interest, I'm sorry to say. 
 The great virtue of Steinmetz's narrative is the force and clarity of certain of his descriptions of events and circumstances of AR's life. For example, his pages on the months and days of AR's last illness are riveting and horrifying. I have no idea why AR consented to endure the final stages of terminal bone cancer. But he did. 
 Nonetheless, my impression is that Steinmetz offered me nothing that served either to enhance or correct my understanding either of the man or his life. Steinmetz indulged a habit that I find highly annoying. He drops here and there altogether vacuous phrases - for which he offers not the first word of explanation - and then abandons them for other words that refer to nothing specific. For example, he writes (p. 169): ""a certain pledge to existence would later unravel on a bed in Marseilles, burned out from an overdose of the absolute."" [What is the ""absolute""? How much of it constitutes an overdose? And by the way, how does one imbibe that particular quantity?] Then this ""theme"" disappears from Steinmetz's pages. Then there's this annoyance (p. 222): ""after this time ... Rimbaud no longer believes in literature. He forsakes this 'practice' for other, more effective ones that permit him to be 'absolutely modern'."" [S. attaches no reference to this quote.] It escapes me altogether how any competent biographer of AR could even begin to think that this man would ever formulate and/or adopt a set of conventions (to which one could attach a label) as obligatory standards of behavior. And again, (p. 225): ""Now here is Rimbaud the realist ... who wishes to go to Greece .. with the hope of finding a modern kind of job: making soap, for example!"" [Is the making of soap one of mankind's recent achievements?] From that point the word ""modern"" does not appear again in Steinmetz's bio. Then there's ""Rimbaud, hardened in his own created image,"" without so much as one word of rationale for his claim that AR formulated and projected a concept of self and then proceeded to make life decisions, to behave as if that image/concept were some sort of standard to which he had to conform. Non-sense. Then there's this: ""It is difficult to determine his true nature. (p. 346)"", ""the real Rimbaud,"" ""Rimabud's identity remains a secret. (p. 348)"" Quite as if self and identify were fixed entities to which one might attach specific attributes, as if one might measure the atomic weight of one molecule of identity and the ""real"" self. 
 Most annoying of all, however, is the book's subtitle: ""Presence of an Enigma."" Steinmetz appears to use enigma in two senses, one of which is dubious at best. In certain passages he associates ""enigma"" with his assessment of the state of biographical information regarding one event or another in AR's life, referring specifically to gaps in the record. That absence characterizes our knowledge of AR's biography, the uncertainties that inhere in any conclusions we draw from the incomplete and often conflicting, unclear, conflicting information in the collection that remains to us. I can't think how gaps in the record render AR enigmatic at all. The state of our knowledge is not an attribute of AR. In other passages Steinmetz uses ""enigmatic"" to characterize desires, drives in AR that would remain inexplicable even if we were completely informed, if the record were entirely complete. Yet Steinmetz doesn't give reasons for his characterization. ""Enigmatic"" for whom? Why ""enigmatic""? What exactly places a reasonably certain understanding of AR and the trajectory of his life beyond our grasp? Steinmetz doesn't say. He simply lets the word dangle. I have no patience whatever with this sort of parlor game. 
 So what am I left with? Much clearer images of certain places, circumstances and events in AR's life than either Robb or Nicholls enabled. Not much else - except for the laugh at myself that I laughed at being taken in by that notorious publisher's ploy - an intriguing - but ultimately vacuous - subtitle."

Shaye's memory begins to reveal itself with each new clue unraveled. It's that old adage; perhaps some things are best left alone. Will I read WICKED, the fourth book in the series? Of course. I enjoyed the first two books and don't necessarily subscribe to that one-bad-apple kind of thinking. I liked it, but think DeLeon has more to offer.

At first I thought it would be a sweeping historical novel that was more about its setting in time and place than its characters, but it turned out to be much more plot and character-driven than that. No way just a concepty experiment in interweaving real lives and fictional ones. I really liked Doctorow's dispassionate, neutral voice too - I will chase up some more of his work now.

 UNDERSTANDING MYSELF: A Kid's guide to intense emotions and strong feelings' by Berkeley clinical psychologist/psychoanalyst Mary C. Lama, PhD is a brave undertaking. As the adult reader takes the time to read this book the first reaction is that the information in the book may just be too advanced for the suggested age 8 to 13 category of young people. And there is a strong hint there that Dr. Lama doesn't nee to make apparent: if this information seems too sensitive for kids then the adult reader needs some introspection and possible work on their own! Dr. Lama takes on the field of emotions - that inner aspect of human behavior that in many ways determines juts how effective we will be in dealing with the world. She simply believes that if young people get an early start on appreciating those aspects of the mind that have little to do with school performance but MUCH to do with social interaction and self understanding, then the opening of the door to mental health as they mature will be a more informed process. 
 The book is divided into seven parts: Feeling Your Emotions in which the science of emotions (yes!) leads to definitions of moods, emotions, feelings; Felling Self-Conscious deals with the concepts of embarrassment, guilt, shame, and pride; Feeling Threatened discusses anxiety, fear and disgust; Feeling Gloomy addresses loneliness, sadness and grief; Feeling Elated explores excitement/joy/happiness and love/infatuation; and Felling Stormy explains anger and envy/jealousy. Each of these topics are first defined so that the reader hears from an expert just what those emotions really are, examples are given, tests are available, and Psych Notes are offered. All of this information is dealt with in a warm supportive manner, bringing the young person up to speed with the terminology as well as the etiology and repercussions and benefits of understanding the beginnings of emotions and how comfortable to incorporate this knowledge in finding a happier path of living. 
 This book may be created for ages 8 through 13, but after reading UNDERSTANDING MYSELF cover to cover it seems to this reader that the book would well serve the high school and college student - as well as the adults among us who still remain in the dark about these important concepts. Look for this book to garner awards on many levels. It is published by the MAGINATION PRESS under the auspices of the American Psychological Association. That backing, as well as the personal impact of Dr. Lama, should make this book a part of every family's library.

The letters he wrote describing the beauty of where he lives touched her heart and made her long for something she hadn't had in years - a place to belong. Things don't go quite as she hoped, as Jack's first reaction to her seems to be dismay. 
 Jack had certainly not expected the young woman in the fashionable clothing, who can't even look him in the eye. As they travel toward his home he discovers that she can't cook, knows nothing of growing food, and seems to be afraid to even touch him. He's bitterly disappointed and has no trouble letting it show. 
 Olivia sees his disappointment, and feels rejected already. She has grown up feeling that she doesn't meet anyone's expectations. Her parents died in a train wreck when she was a child and she was raised by an older woman who rarely had anything good to say to her. As an adult she worked in a cotton mill where she was also looked down on. Ever since writing to Jack she has dreamed of finally having someone who accepts her for who she is. If she wants to make her marriage work she has to learn a new way of life. 
 I felt bad for Olivia because she was way out of her depth. She had never experienced anything like the wilderness she was now going to be living in. She waffles back and forth between wanting to stay and make it work with Jack and wanting to leave because she can see he doesn't want her. She's also extremely innocent, and doesn't understand the feelings that Jack rouses in her. They scare her a bit and cause her to shrink away from him. It takes a near tragedy for her to see that she is stronger than she thinks she is. I liked seeing her start to display the strength she'll need to have the future she wants. 
 I was a bit frustrated with Jack. I got the impression that he hadn't been all that specific in his letters to Olivia about what he actually expected of her. I felt that he could have at least offered to teach her what she needed to know. Instead, all he can see is that she doesn't fit the preconceived picture he had in his mind of what the perfect wife would be. Jack spends a lot of time comparing her to his mother, who had left him and his father because she couldn't handle the life there, and to his late Indian wife, who had known exactly what needed to be done and how to do it. Added to that, he's really attracted to her, but afraid to get close because it will hurt when she leaves. So he blows hot and cold with her, as the attraction makes him want her to stay, but his fears cause him to push her away. 
 Things would have gone much more smoothly with them if they would have just talked to each other about what they were feeling. They were so busy protecting themselves that they couldn't see what needed to be done. The only times they really communicated in any way was when the attraction would take over. I did like Jack's patience and gentleness with Olivia and her innocence. 
 I liked the section where they were caring for Jack's former brother-in-law. It was a terrific demonstration of the things that could happen and how they would need to be dealt with. I loved seeing the progression that Olivia made from her fears at the beginning of it, to her courage and determination by the time Jack came back. I also liked seeing that Jack finally realized what an idiot he'd been. The plans they made for their future together were an excellent compromise to both their needs. The only thing that might have made it better would be an epilogue from a year or so later."

With everyone stranded at the community center by a blizzard, Hannah solves the mystery of who stole her mother's antique Christmas cake knife AND how it ended up in the new Las Vegas showgirl wife of Martin Dubinski. 
 Joanne Fluke has so much fun with the wacky and delightful characters of Lake Eden. Their names, alone (i.e. Mary Kay Hinklemeyer) make you laugh when you read this. This book is a great, quick ""anytime of the year"" read with over 50 recipes in the back to try.

The last half of the book is the Lake Eden cookbook Hannah has been compiling of local town recipes since the last book. The town is hosting a potluck dinner with all the recipes submitted for the cookbook on display from appetizers to desserts. The whole town gathers at the community center for the big event including one newcomer; Martin Dubinski is bringing his new wife, a Vegas Showgirl names Brandi, but the guests include former wife, Shirley, and his Mom, Babs, who is firmly in Shirley's camp. The description of the food is awesome and Hannah's Mom, Delores, loans from her antique shop a ancient bejeweled knife to slice the cakes. When Hannah heads to the kitchen to replenish the food tables, she notices the back door is open. Since the town is in the midst of a snowstorm, Hannah rushes to close it and notices a furry animal lying in the parking lot. She approaches it and finds Brandi in her fur coat, with the ancient knife buried in her chest! Mike, one of Hannah's beaus and chief detective, sets up an office and tells Hannah the killer is probably still in the building since the exit is completely blocked by snow. Soon enough, Hannah and her sister, Andrea, pregnant and two weeks overdue, begin compiling a suspect list. They soon discover Brandi was born just a few towns over as Mary Hinklemeyer and she wasn't a Vegas showgirl but a stripper. The band teacher, Kirby, reveals Mary was his first girlfriend and they also find out Mayor Bascomb had a date with Brandi in Vegas, though it fell through. When they decide to go through Norman's pictures, you'll remember him as the town dentist and Hannah's other beau, they find out Brandi stole the knife and had planned to leave Martin that night with Kirby, and hock her ring, the knife and her fur coat. And apparently, Martin had planned to leave Brandi, too, and return to Shirley. With all that intrigue going on I'll leave you with this final note: this murder turned out to be something entirely different but you'll have to read the book to find out! And get those wonderful recipes!

The recipes look yummy though. I just wish the story had been longer and less fluffy.

 1. It all took place in one night while people were locked in a building because of a blizzard. Yes, it's a bit cliche, but I felt the plot device really worked for the story and gave it a bit more unity. Plus, I was kinda kept guessing because of the circumstances of the murder--the resolution wasn't as obvious as sometimes. 
 2. There are 50 recipes in this book. One plot point is the publishing of a town cookbook and basically the entirety of the cookbook is contained in the pages. PLUS, if you read it, there are little notes to the recipes regarding some of the characters and such. I love when things like that are integrated into the story."

 A holiday theme buffet showcasing foods that will be appearing in Hannah's upcoming cookbook sets the food tone for the book. Unfortunately for Hannah, she again finds a dead body and she and her entourage go about investigating. I always enjoy murder mysteries that take place in a confined space in which the murderer is among the guests, think Murder on the Orient Express and And Then There Were None (Ms. Christie at her best!). Just listening to all the food that's being placed out for the buffet made me salivate and I'm glad to see 80+ recipes provided...and just in time to make a few for my own holiday party. 
 That's what I loved about the Sugar Cookie. Sadly there was so much more that didn't work for me. 
 One, Hannah. The Hannah in the tv series is quirky and lovable. The Hannah in the book reminded me of a spoiled petulant child. One scene where she interrupts Mike while he's interviewing a suspect, he tells her to leave. The petulant child slams the door and stomps away going, ""I'll show him"". Um, Hannah, Mike is doing his job, you're the one that interrupted him. Ugh! I found the book Hannah annoying and unlikable. Then there's Mike. The tv Mike is handsome, patient, and a good cop. The book Mike is also handsome and a good cop but he comes across as a chauvinistic pig. 
 The plot is simplistic and Hannah just takes everybody's word for it. Oh, you say you were in the kitchen with so-and-so, oh, so you couldn't possibly be the killer. She never questioned that people could be lying. She would take people off of her suspect list for the dumbest reasons. No tension, no howdunit, no suspense. It took 100 pages to get to the one and only murder and only around 75 pages till the murderer confessed. That's right, the murderer just confesses to Hannah. Ugh!!! 
 The lack of depth to the story and the annoying characters will have me only watching Hannah on Hallmark. I need a mystery that actually provides a mystery. But I love all the recipes!"

 Short Review: I felt like there was a crap ton of recipes in this but i didn't really connect that this is a holiday book so of course she would list more recipes... Anyhow, i don't really get the big deal about this dumb knife that went missing, and really the person killed doesn't even make sense to be the one being killed, like the explanation was too farfetched for me, and of course Hannah finds the bottom, but it made me laugh to read about how Hannah's cookies were around the dead body!

In this book the entire ""mystery"" is solved in a few hours while the entire town is stuck at the Community Center for a potluck when a blizzard hits. While the addition of the recipes gives some added interest, I don't think I'm going to be making Minnesota Hot Dish anytime soon. A quick read on vacation and wouldn't read again - will probably skip catching up on series unless a book jacket catches my eye later in the series."

After reading a few of these books you come to really know the characters and feel like you are a part of the small town they live in. This makes up for the only-modest mystery. I pegged the resolution to this book early on and was puzzled why I was less than 60% through the book, only to find many pages of recipes at the back of the book. I like reading the series but don't expect to be seriously taxed by a complex murder mystery.

That is till Angel learns her father has been lying to her all those years about her mother Betty Lou. Plus it doesn't help any that Angel is dealing with narcolepsy as well as her dad's new girlfriend, Carla moving in. Angel doesn't like Carla. The first thing Carla does when she moves in with her and her dad is to take down all the pictures of Betty Lou. While Angel tries to make sense of all the things happening around her, she won't be alone. She will have her two friends from her cotton picking job. They are Tim, a gay guy who likes to party and Kimmy, a twenty-something virgin who lives in a trailer park. As well as one other person who cares for Angel a lot. His name is Mac; he is a doctor as well as married. Read Aberrations as Angel tries to reveal the truth about who her mother is but be warned as the saying goes ""The truth shall set you free"". 
 Let me first off start by saying what a delightful treat Aberrations was. I do have to admit though that I do not know much on the subject matter of narcolepsy. I know that it is a sleeping disorder but I didn't realize all the symptoms a person has to deal with. So on that note I found Angel to be a very strong and brave woman despite the circumstances she has to deal with when she learns her father has lied to her. Ms. Penelope Przekop's Aberrations was a very well-written as well as thought out book. Penelope Przekop really did her homework on narcolepsy. I appreciate an author who does their research whether it is fiction or non fiction as I than find the story to become more real and to draw me in more. Aberrations was my first book by this author but I can honesty say I would check out other books by Penelope Przekop ."

I think Angel is better off not knowing the truth. There are many secrets that go deep and back many years. For years it has torn one man and a family apart leaving them broken, filled with sorrow and so much pain. You think you know what is going on but the author throws some major twist on this that will break your heart as you watch Angel go through the steps of finding out what really happened to her mother. 
 Ms. Roberts's narration as always is outstanding. She has a way that really pulls the listener in giving you an audio that keeps you hanging on the edge. Her natural voice is just as pleasant as her character voices. Her males are strong, bold and at times broken men that you love as you feel their pain. Her female voices are very natural from her very young to the very old. She puts so much passion and emotion into them you get lost in the story. There are neither background noises nor any volume changes. There is no repeat of words just a clear, clean and crisp audio. Ms. Roberts's puts so much emotion into her audio's you never have trouble knowing who is talking or what they are feeling. When their heart breaks yours breaks right along with it. This is a very emotion and powerful story that Ms. Roberts's has no trouble pulling off. If any breaks were taken I could not tell. This is one of my favorite narrators when I see her name I know I am in for a treat. 
 I have mixed emotions over this plot it was good, interesting and pulls you in. There is no doubt your heart will break as does Angel's and her family. I thought the writing style was great, I can't put my finger on it but something was just a little off for me. I felt so much pain for Angel's father he gave his all but it just didn't seem good enough. He was always there her first but when it was time for him to find his own life things didn't go so well. I have mixed emotions for his girlfriend I just couldn't get a handle on her. She went from wicked step mother to someone you could relate to but she was just so wishy washy. Angel at times comes off as a spoiled brat. There were characters I really liked and some not so much. I never really understood why her mother's family felt the way they did. All in all it was a good read I did enjoy it but it just didn't come together well for me. I think it is well worth a 4 star the author does pull you in giving you many twists and turns you won't see coming. Give it a try I thought it was worth my time."

It means she can fall asleep at no notice and she also suffers with cataplexy which can leave her body asleep, but the mind still awake. The book shows how difficult life can be for Angel as she has to rely on others so much, but she meets 2 new friends: Tim & Kimmy and she tries to overcome her narcolepsy by using a drug of the non prescription type. Throughout the novel Angel is on a mission to find out about her mother who apparently died whilst giving birth and her father is unable to discuss this with her as the pain appears too much for him. He has a new relationship with Carla, who is a down to earth lawyer and try's in her way to help Angel, but Angel is not ready to accept her help. 
 A great novel; I loved this book. It was an amazing emotional journey with true depth and I felt it gave a real understanding of the characters. We see people in their true colours; warts and all, including Mac who is married, but at the same time is having an affair. One can't but help warm to his character, but it left me uneasy at times as I felt by liking him I was almost condoning his adultery. Even though we did not know his wife to any great degree in the novel, she was still a valid person and did she deserve this? However this is what happens in life and it's not all pretty colours and this novel shows the dilemmas in life very well; people are fallible, but this doesn't make them totally bad. I also began to question if the illicit drug that Angel took for improving her narcolepsy would actually help and if it did I wondered if there was any clinical testing being done with regards to this; leaving me with research to do. 
 This novel was great for getting me to think; it had a wonderful flowing story, was written in a very effective way and also had me connecting emotionally to the characters. I couldn't ask for more. 
 I highly recommend this book."

Her mom died when she was a baby and she has never been able to really reach her father, Frank, through the wall of grief that he built up. Friendships were difficult to maintain. When you have Narcolepsy everything requires a huge effort and most days Angel is just not up to it. At twenty-one years old, Angel is attending college and living at home, trying to create a future for herself. Things become more difficult when her dad's girlfriend, Carla, moves in, upsetting the fragile balance that has existed for years between Angel and her dad. 
 When the novel opens it is spring and Angel is working two jobs. At the first job, a hospital, she is having an affair with a married doctor named Mac. He appeals to her because he understands her condition, accepts her as she is and fits into the fringes of her life. At the other job she meets Kimmy and Tim, who become the first real friends that she has ever had. They expose her to a seedy underground lifestyle that centers mostly on drugs and sex. But they stand by her in a way that she has never experienced before. 
 Angel's mother was a photographer. She took a whole series of pictures of clouds that resembled things from everyday life, a duck, a horse, a snake. Twenty two photos of clouds have hung on the wall for the last twenty years. When Carla arrives she takes them all down, meaning to re-frame them one by one. The loss of the photos jars Angel and leads her down a path of uncovering old secrets. Eventually she comes to realize how she has let the Narcolepsy control her life and finally learns that truth, in all of its forms, is the key to happiness."

I love the first chapter that introduces the reader to the relationships between the 3 girlfriends Emmie, Rayna and Lurlene. This is a fun loving and devoted set of ladies that will lead the readers into the three books in the Breaking the Declan Brothers Series. 
 This book drew me in with Jax, the oh so polite darker responsible older brother, who has loved Emmie since she was a jailbait teenager and while waiting for her to grow up lost her before he could tell her. The author does a wonderful job of peeling away the personal history layers between Emmie and Jax throughout the book showing Jax as a person deep down who has loved only one person but was afraid of his intense sexual needs. 
 Emmie's character is quite fulfilling to me as she starts out wanting to break Jax who she always had a crush on. She is not afraid to flaunt her princess pageant body in a manner to get his attention without looking cheap. But I love how she changes directions when her heart kicks into gear and wants this man. 
 This is full of story lines to keep you busy. So sit down and grab your favorite cup of coffee or tea and enjoy.

For Emmie and Rayna this is a return to their childhood lives and the Declan boys - Jax, Slate and Zeke. Emmie had a huge crush on Jax but he never gave her the time of day. Her goal is to break Jax over the summer. I loved how Kelly Gendron established the three best friends spending the summer together while giving us just the right mix of past/present to help us understand how the Declan boys fit into Emmie and Rayna's world. I also loved the dual POV which gave us a better understanding of who the Declan boys are and what they are dealing with. Excited to read Slate and Zeke's stories. A copy was provided to me for an honest review.

I freaking loved Jax and can't wait to read the rest of the series! Lurlene, Rayna, and Emmie are best friends looking for something to do for the summer. That something turns into the Declan brothers, Jax, Zeke, and Slate. The Declan brothers were always extremely hot and earned the reputation for being extremely unattainable when they were younger. The girls decide spend their summer breaking the Declan brothers. 
 The series starts off with Jax and Emmie. Emmie had a huge crush on Jax when they were younger but he didn't seem to notice her flirting or flat out ignored them. Jax noticed but felt he wasn't the right guy for Emmie, but now that she's all grown up things are about to change. I suggest you start this series and don't let go. 
 Side note: Very nice cover"

Rictus has aged a bit, taken a wife, fathered some kids, and really wants to just sit back and relax for a while. Following the events of The Ten Thousand, Rictus and his Dogsheads have become living legends. While Rictus attempts to readjust to civilian life, a young upstart by the name of Corvus is carving his way through the Macht world. Corvus is no ordinary warlord; he wants to unite the Macht into one unified Country and give them something they have never had before...A King. 
 Corvus knows that he needs Rictus and his famous company of mercenaries in order to accomplish his goal of unity. (Or conquest depending on how one views the situation) Rictus reluctantly agrees to fight alongside Corvus, but that's only due to the fact that he wants to keep his family safe. The majority of the novel follows Corvus and Rictus as they make their way across the Macht Kingdom. The finale is a great battle that determines the future of the Macht society. Will Corvus become King, uniting the Macht under one leader, or will the resistance defeat the ruthless tyrant? 
 This was another great book by Kearney, and I'm beginning to get a sense of his style. The book's pace develops quickly, and Kearney doesn't drag his feet in his storytelling. You won't find lengthy descriptions of clothing or food, and the political discussions all advance the plot instead of dragging it down. Much like The Ten Thousand there are some great action scenes early on in the story, but the finale is really where Kearney shines. The man knows how to write a good battle scene, placing the reader right in the middle of the action. The smells, sounds, and fury of battle are all gorgeously realized. 
 The early chapters of the book really build around Corvus's reputation. He is described as a younger man, who doesn't quite look like a full blooded Macht. He is ruthless, and yet very fair and just to the subjects he conquers. I found myself intrigued by Corvus, and I really wanted to know just who this young man was that conquers such hard people with ease. I'm not a History major, but I think Kearny was inspired by Alexander the Great in terms of developing Corvus. Once again the ""fantasy"" here is very minimal; fans of historical fiction will find a lot to like. 
 This was a quick read, and one that I would recommend to people who are craving a good story but may not have a lot of time to dedicate to reading. My schedule is a bit hectic right now, and I don't have much free time but I was able to pick the book up after a few weeks without being completely lost. If you're a fast reader I'm sure you could knock this whole trilogy out in a weekend, I would if I had the time! 
 All in all this was a solid sequel that doesn't suffer from the dreaded middle book syndrome. While the tragic despair of The Ten Thousand is missing, there is still a hell of a lot to enjoy in this one. Kings of Morning concludes the Macht trilogy, and I can't wait to see how Kearney brings this story to a close."

Probably not terribly age appropriate, really into cupcakes, princess things as an adult, and the color pink. Much of the essay explores the phenomenon citing various examples in the culture. Don't really know how to think about this essay other than a provocative conversation starter as to what the heck we think about these quirky pixie girls. Personally, I am pretty ambivalent about these folks. As a man, I don't know that I fully understand the sexual attraction. (I continue to be surprised that when I play the would you rather game with friends and the subjects are ScarJo and Zooey that many of them still pick Zooey - yuck.) But, alternatively I can only read so many think-pieces in erudite magazines like the Atlantic or something about women climbing the corporate ladder and balancing motherhood and career, etc. - I understand the instinct in some women to want to go to the comfort of Katy Perry tunes about how awesome California girls are. I am both amused and kinda unnerved by all the Hello Kitty paraphernalia I see at the 30 something bars I like to frequent and I think that's okay. 
 Either way, the essay makes you think and makes you want to talk to your friends, that's kinda why we read non-fiction, so kudos to Deborah Schoeneman I say."

Schoeneman explores the budding new phenomenon called Woman-Child, in which grown women dress younger than their age, prefer neon colored nail polish, glitter and young adult fiction, remain single and bond with other women over it all. 
 What Schoeneman does remarkably well is present her bias without being judgmental. Her search is more a genuine curiosity to understand the woman-child than to attack it and by the end she makes positives strides at overcoming her bias. 
 What bothered me most about the essay is that the woman-child even be a phenomenon at all! The only reason it is an issue is because someone says it is. 
 Schoeneman often compares reality vs. woman-child as if there is something deluded about the style. She doesn't ever mention that nostalgia culture is big, period, simply because there is such as ease of access to it. She raises the issue of movies and grown women, that more adults see flicks geared toward younger audiences instead of age appropriate ones. She says that movies geared toward women in their 30's (ex: What to Expect When You're Expecting) are realistic vs movies geared toward teens (ex: Te Hunger Games) are fantasy without bothering to really touch on the basis of story content. Women don't want movies about how tiring their lives are, that mock how busy they are. She briefly touches on economic influence as a reason for delayed adolescence, but not enough. 
 But by the end of the essay, the author comes to a conclusion that is uplifting and definitely pro women no matter if you wear polkadots & glitter or tweed & pant suits."

(In effect, is the Good, is morality, somehow ""above"" the gods?) Or is morality just attributing high falutin' notions to one's own emotional preferences and prejudices, ""dressing feelings up with flowers""? 
 There are a few good reasons to read this book: (1) you have just finished reading Plato's Dialogues and desire a light, humorous palate cleanser. (2) you have read some of Iris Murdoch's fiction and wonder about her 20C apparent obsession with that hoary classical notion of The Good, and want to see that spelled out a little. (3) You are a teacher of philosophy and are looking for a tightly-written, brief overview of various possible moral attitudes, as well as something to enliven the class after wrestling with something difficult. 
 Short and sweet, and even better on a second reading, as Murdoch raises questions that she refuses to answer, but these stay with you and tease you into thought and hopefully out of confidence in your own moral and aesthetic assumptions."

Milanovic does a great job of explaining how we determine relative income and wealth across hundreds of very different nations, and the history of the field.

And then, at the end, once he's explained why thirty years of increasing global inequality is A VERY BAD THING, he didn't offer any specific solutions or even point at where solutions might be found. I found that damn frustrating. While I appreciate the background, I'm only reading this to understand the way forward.

 I'm glad to see authors have found, or are at least trying to find, a happy medium between the hero being perceived as bad--maybe actually being bad--and being completely misunderstood (hint: I'd rather the author actually redeem a bad guy than just throw everything away on misunderstanding). Also, I am SO happy that the appeal of a heroine is no longer solely dependent on her virginity and beauty (sometimes her appeal IS these things, but I think improvements have been made in this regard). 
 I really enjoyed the darkness that pervaded the first half of this novel. I got a good sense of how broken Alastair felt, but Olivia's POVs served to break up the darkness so it wasn't too overwhelming. These two were pretty sympathetic as characters, and they definitely shared a few sexy moments. But I felt their progression from employee/employer to something more happened too quickly. As a result, the darkness characterizing their interactions sort of just disappeared, and the last 30% or so of the book felt almost light and silly in comparison. 
 The writing was very good, but the novel felt uneven and a touch too long. By the time Alastair and Olivia were leaving London, I felt my interest waning. The ending didn't feel quite satisfying. I'm not sure this book did much to restore my faith in the romance genre, and I won't go out of my way to read more by Duran."

 Massachusetts author Ross Jennings comes to writing from the IT world. After dreaming of becoming a writer for years he stepped onto the stage with his Bedazzled Billionaires Series: WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE was Book 1 and now the story continues with Book 2, IT TAKES TWO TO TANGO. He lives with his family in Boston. 
 It is always interesting to note comments from the author who is presenting his work before the pubic for the first time. One short quotation is found at the back of this book - 'Sex is at the heart of what it means to be human. It's vitally important to nearly all of us. It's a driving force in our daily lives (even when we're celibate), and its mysteries are infinite. I believe, that nothing is hotter than authenticity, discipline, inventiveness and depth.' In this short note Ross has captured our attention and we explore his creative world eagerly. 
 Ross writes in a genre frequently at the focal point of so-called Chick Lit (think EL James et al) but he steps into another realm of Thriller and what we find ins an erotically charged romantic thriller - the audience now far more broad and accessible! He knows how to open the proscenium arch for the stage on which to place his actors - 'Abraham Patterson, to his own surprise, found the end of the world arousing. Maybe it was the uniqueness of the event, which was akin to a visit by Haley's Comet, except magnified by a million times. Or maybe it was the sense that he and his lover, Jody Atwood, only had seconds to live. Whatever the case may be, as he and Jody Atwood stood on top of Mount Tamalpais, with the darkened cities of San Francisco and Oakland looming in the distance, Patterson's only thought was of bending Jody over and fucking her one last time. He wanted to hear her scream his name in ecstasy before the Singularity engulfed them in a wave of chaos. This was assuming, of course, that the Singularity was actually underway. The dreaded Singularity - or the A.I. Apocalypse, as it was also known - had been predicted by tech-minded doomsayers for decades. Until only a minute ago, Patterson had considered the concept total hogwash. But that was before the surrounding urban sprawl had gone black at the precise moment the Ragnarok Project had acquired all of the world's digital data.' Ross' expertise in the technicalities of IT shines through 
 Ross opens his book with a fine plot summary - 'Multi-billionaire Abraham Patterson is back in the line of fire. With a technological apocalypse looming, Patterson and his hot-to-trot companion, Jody Atwood, are on the run from an army of masked marauders. Their pursuers are as brutal as they are relentless, forcing the couple into one nail-biting situation after another. But somehow the multi-billionaire and his sexy sidekick still find stolen moments to lose themselves in pleasure. Will Abraham Patterson and Jody Atwood stay ahead of their faceless pursuers? Will they outsmart the dark forces plotting against them? Or will they fall into the hands of the most sadistic minds on the planet? The only way to find out is to dive into the delirious pages of this highly addictive thriller.' 
 And that is all you really need to now to realize that if it is thriller plus steamy erotica that appeals, this author has the concept down pat. He is headed toward a very successful career in this popular arena of book writing."

I think that was mainly because of the multiple characters and each chapter being from a different character's point of view. Once I got the main characters firmly in place in my mind and how they related to each other it got better. I was intrigued by the story and I grew to care a lot about each person and how this was all going to work out.

Solidly average book overall, not one I would buy, but worked well to pass the time when I had 7 hours in an airport to do nothing but read.

But about half way in it hooks you. I loved it to the point where I read all the way to the last page of the authors notes. I loved Summer Sisters, but to be fair I was 18. I'm still not sure that this book has the same magic, but it kept me hooked to the very end.

She is suffering the angst of belonging to a very special secret club of members joined by a tragic winter long ago. 
 Flash back to December 1951, to a small New Jersey town called Elizabeth. Christmas lights are out and there is gaiety in the air. It won't be long, though, before everything changes for the residents of this picturesque town. 
 The first plane crash comes only days later, with everyone aboard dead. It landed in a riverbed, so the damage below was negligible. 
 The residents of the town haven't even recovered when, in January 1952, the second crash occurs. And a month later, another one. 
 Henry Ammerman is a journalist covering the story for the local newspaper, and he finds a measure of fame through his provocative columns, as he probes the questions that plague them all. What is happening? Are the crashes coincidental, or is there some kind of sabotage behind them? Some blame ""the Communists,"" while the teenagers mention aliens. 
 As the story unfolds, we meet numerous characters, some seemingly random and their presence in the tale becomes readily apparent, as they connect in some way to the plane crashes. Like Ruby Granik, a young dancer and a victim; or Kathy Stein, who has been dating Steve Osner, a resident of Elizabeth, also dead in one of the crashes. 
 Miri Ammerman, the daughter of single mom Rusty and niece of Henry, is fifteen, and her life is shaken by these happenings, just as the life of her best friend Natalie Osner takes a strange turn. Has Natalie been ""taken over"" by the deceased spirit of one of the victims? 
 Even as I loved certain aspects of this novel, the numerous characters, most mentioned only once or twice, were confusing and distracting. I would have loved to dig more deeply into the lives of the primary characters, like what has Rusty been feeling all these years, raising Miri alone, with no help from the father? And when he does appear, why is she so reluctant to let him help? How do the core characters deal with the aftermath of these events? 
 Then, almost abruptly, we flash forward to 1987, with Miri returning to Elizabeth for a memorial of that strange year. And in a quick summarizing of events, we are caught up on what has transpired in the lives of those residents, another reminder of how much I would have enjoyed the story with more depth and a focus on the core characters. An engaging novel, however. 4 stars."

Eventually, it all came together nicely, and the arm feeling of nostalgia that came over me wasn't once lost throughout Judy Blume's work. It has provided a nice snapshot of a town during a specific time, while making the other components of the story: adolescence, first love, family obligation universal and soft. This book was a nice way to reconnect with the author I loved in my youth, and while there wasn't much substance behind it, sometimes a book like this is just what you're looking for.

As many other reviewers have mentioned, there are lots and lots of POVs here and for the first 20% or so of this book, I would sometimes have trouble remembering how everyone was interrelated or involved. But as I got further into the book, it settles down to some main characters to whom we return again and again. I was really hooked and drawn further into the book by the ""Based on a true story"" aspect of three plane crashes in a less than 60 day period and found the exploration of how different characters felt and thought about the events as they were happening to be very interesting. Definite coming of age themes here, but also some odd, unexplained stuff and a few characters I was left wanting more from. To me, the ending - which returns to something much closer to the present time (which is also where we began) - didn't work. I didn't want a neat bow on all these folks and what they became and almost would have preferred the book left us hanging about how it all turned out. Enjoyable and absorbing read for me."

And I thought if I had to read the words Volupte compacts one more time I'd scream. I realize Ms. Blume was setting the mood of the 1950s, but the name dropping of every brand of underwear, nightgowns, cosmetics, and clothing got old. Yet the novel as a whole haunted me, and stuck with me. Sometimes the horror that is in novels doesn't feel like it's happening to the reader. With In the Unlikely Event, the plane crashes stuck with me, even gave me nightmares for a couple of nights. Even though I got tired of Lintz nightgowns and Vanity Fair slips and Ship and Shore blouses, I found the book as a whole deep and haunting.

This book came to me because I receive the POP Sugar subscription box, and this novel was included in the June box. I also don't have the same affinity for Judy Blume based purely on nostalgia. I did not read her books when I was a young adult, so there is no warmth biased on my childhood at play. 
 That being said, I am glad this book found its way to me. Set in 1950's New Jersey, the novel centers around, primarily, a 15 year old girl named Miri and those within her social circle. It is both a story about growing up and a story about how even in the face of tragedy, life goes on. There is no sweeping plot other than the progression of time if the face of tragic events. I can see how some would call it boring, but for me, it was moving both for how mundane life is and how even when big things happen, years go by. It is inevitable. Blume balances that delicate place in life where you are eternally stuck in the same age as when something life changing has happened, and yet you are completely different all at the same time."

They live in a house with Miri's grandmother and uncle just downstairs and Miri has good friends and the possibilities of first love as she and her town face a cataclysm of scary events. In the space of a few months - 3 airplanes crash in Elizabeth, NJ as they are landing or taking off from near by Newark Airport. The fear each crash brings - and the people known and unknown who die in each crash - have the entire town searching for answers. Especially among the teenagers who feel it may be more of a planned destruction of their lives - not just random accidents. Miri is well presented as are her friends - Natalie who becomes possessed with the spirit of one of the victims of the first crash. Mason - her first love who saves countless people in the third crash but also breaks Miri's heart. And other friends who leave as all of them face death of townspeople they know - killed for no good reason. Their is also the story of Miri's mother who finds love but at the expense of Natalie's family, Uncle Henry who writes the stories of these crashes while planning his wedding, and her grandmother Irene who finds companionship and ultimately love with a widower from one of the crashes. The family finally leaves Elizabeth for the new frontier town of Las Vegas - all affected by what occurred over that winter and all changed as they learn to find a strength to get past the horror. Amazing this story is based on true facts - I never knew.

The things that Mark Twain had Adam & Eve ""discover"" was really thought provoking. The characterization was really fun (how Adam & Eve interacted/reacted to each other). I also loved what Adams definition of Eden was at the end of the book. At the end of the reading Walter Cronkite explained some background to the reasons behind Mark Twain's writing of this book. He started it because of his wife, but wasn't able to find the right way to finish it. It wasn't until she passed away that he knew how he wanted to finish it. It was ""his valentine to her"" - very sweet tribute."

But then I read excerpts to my husband and he didn't laugh at all, so maybe it's just my kind of humor. Written as Twain's idea of what Adam and Eve must have thought of each other. I laughed as I read the beginning and middle. Then I cried at the sweet tender ending (supposedly a tribute to his own beloved wife.) A quick read, it took me about an hour to read but only because I kept re-reading the funniest parts. I am not very generous with my 5 star ratings, but this one will definitely go on my ""favorites"" list."

But Nanny Ogg and Granny Weatherwax ""can't be having"" with that, so the witches get involved. If you're well read in vampires (or at least have seen a lot of old Hammer movies), it's even funnier the way he manipulates popular quotes, tropes, and tricks -- but with his usually sincerity running underneath. And lest you think it's just a laugh-fest, he explores religion as well, through a Priest of Om whose views conflict with Nanny's (she thinks he's a narrow-minded soul), but who winds up saving Granny Weatherwax (and everyone else) on more than one occasion. He pokes gentle fun at everything, slams it a bit harder with probing questions, and then reminds us of how faith begins. It's a lovely little read."

Most of the book revolved around Agnes, who was interesting enough, but I really missed the typical Granny Weatherwax attitude toward everyone and everything. There was still some of that, but there was much less of her than I've grown used to in these novels. Additionally, I really didn't like Igor's dialogue in this book all the lisping th's instead of s's made it really hard to understand what he was saying sometimes. Still a good book, just not as good as most of his other novels with the Witches in it.

I like my vampyres with snark, witches with headology, and Nac Mac Feagles with a good left hook. My only tiny quibble about the story is that it was over too soon. How I love Granny Weatherwax, and I would have liked to have spent more time with her. What a wonderful character she is.

There was a lot more character development of the not-Granny witches. :) Granny Weatherwax was a little out of the scene for much of the book, giving time for the other characters to explore, grow, and fill her shoes. I missed having Granny around though. The book also felt a lot riskier. Usually you just have an interesting adventure that Granny will think her way around, but this time the stakes were higher, the solutions crazier, and the adventure scarier. Super good way to end the witches series!

It is no secret that I love DiscWorld and I adore Granny Weatherwax and so this is one of my favorite books. The spiritual undertones in this book also really speak to me. Here are a few favorite quotes.... 
 -Later on there would be a command performance by that man who put weasels down his trousers, a form of entertainment that Nanny ranked higher than grand opera. 
 -Lancre people looked after the calories and let the vitamins go hang. 
 -Because that was the point, wasn't it? You had to choose. You might be right, you might be wrong, but you had to choose, knowing that the rightness or wrongness might never be clear or even that you were deciding between two sorts of wrongs, that there was not right anywhere. And always, always, you did it by yourself. You were the one there, on the edge, watching and listening. Never any tears, never any apology, never any regrets...You saved all that up in a way that could be used when needed. 
 -She'd never, ever asked for anything in return. And the trouble with not asking for anything in return was that sometimes you didn't get it. 
 -I'd only been married to the first Mr. Ogg for a month before he was getting out of the bath if he needed to pee. You can refine a husband. 
 -No, this is Lancre we're talking about. If we was men, we'd be talking about layin' our lives down for our country. As women, we can talk about laying down. 
 -This was a test. Everything was a test. Everything was a competition. Life put them in front of you every day. You watched yourself all the time. You had to make choices. You never got told which ones were right. Oh, some of the priests said that you got given marks afterward, but what was the point of that? 
 -No, I know you. I've always known you. The Count just let you out to torment me, but I've always known you were there. I've fought you ever day of my life and you'll get no victory now. I knows who you are now, Esmerelda Weatherwax. You don't scare me anymore. 
 -Oh, but I couldn't be having with that. 
 -An' make sure ye initial all the sub-clauses and codicils. We of the Nac mac Feegle are a simple folk, but we write verra comp-lic-ated documents. 
 -Mythology's just the folktales of people who won 'cos they had bigger swords. 
 -Oh, we're always all right. You remember that. We happen to other people! 
 -Bein' human means judgin' all the time. This and that, good and bad, making choices every day....that's human. Mercy's a fine thing, but judgin' comes first. Otherwise you don't know what you're bein' merciful about. 
 -There is only black and white. There's no grays, only white that's got grubby. I'm surprised you don't know that. And sin, young man, is when you treat people as things. Including yourself. That's what sin is. It's not more complicated than that, it ain't. When people say things are a lot more complicated than that, they means they're getting worried that they won't like the truth. People as things, that's where it starts...that's sin. 
 -But you read a lot of books, I'm thinking. Hard to have faith, ain't it, when you read too many books. 
 -That's what true faith would mean, y'see? Sacrificin' your own life, one day at a time, to the flame, declarin' the truth of it, workin' for it, breathin' the soul of it. That's religion. Anything else is just...is just being nice. And a way of keeping in touch with the neighbors. Anyway, that's what I'd be if I really believed. And I don't think that's fashionable right now, 'cos it seems that if you sees evil now you have to wring your hands and say 'oh deary me, we must debate this.' 
 -The role of the lower intestine in the efforts to build a better nation is one that is often neglected by historians. 
 -Everywhere I look I see something holy! You've taught us to see patterns! 
 -We are vampires. We cannot help what we are. Granny replied, ""Only animals can't help what they are."""

All the satire and intelligent commentary on human nature that we've come to expect and love from a Terry book, wonderfully couched in classic horror movie tropes straight from the golden years of Universal and Hammer. There are vampires both modern and old, Igors, spooky castles and rioting mobs. The witches are in fine form -- this is perhaps one of my favourite Granny Weatherwax showdowns, and Mightily Oats is such an unexpected delight. Also, Agnes Nitt really gets to shine with her dual personality coming quite in handy, and it was lovely to see Magrat come into her own as a more ass-kicking lady. 
 And there's the Wee Free Men. It's always a fun time when the Nac Mac Feegle show up. Easily one of my fave Discworld outings, being the horror fan that I am, and there are hundreds of small moments to amuse, delight, and ponder."
