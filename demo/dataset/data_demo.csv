713cc3505e77532b97d0a69812320fa7	4303163	2.0	Complex and captivating, DARKLY showcases Pessl's signature wit and flair for unexpected twists, evoking questions that haunt long after the final page is turned. An absolute delight into the uncanny.
5f0d7ea4515a98abebea35cec77f864c	192805	4.0	I was absolutely captivated by the synopsis for this book initially. It had intrigue, mystery and sounded dark. My kinda thing! I won't give too much of the plot away since it's always best to go in blind with these types of books. It's safe to say, the plot pulled me in. The mystery surrounding it had me turning the pages and what kept me reading. The writing did an amazing job at making me envision the world quite vividly.
5ea69cb1c59ae8a4ef2e5645b9ca0dd7	17307329	4.0	Recommended reading to understand what is going on in middle america, and possibly better explain what is happening in the world today.
b72ec21d0b2163b1537cf477c64da101	17307329	4.0	This book truly messed up my mind. Flew through it because I just had to know what happened!
78902bd65f566d0316b0177686e088ae	36239248	5.0	I really enjoyed this book, and there is a lot to recommend it. It did drag on a little at the end so.
9003d274774f4c47e62f77600b08ac1d	23167683	3.0	A failure on nearly every level. The characters are paper-flat, they all speak in exactly the same (preposterous) voice, and none of them develop an inch. "But that's okay," you might argue; "Pessl's writing a thriller, and plot is her main concern." Fine, but the plot of this novel is deeply, deeply boring. Night Film reads like a would-be thriller by someone who's never actually read a thriller or a mystery. The protagonist stumps around from obvious clue to obvious clue, talking to a host of characters who spill details for no reason.
9131e02af6b7d8d2dd23472b264971af	23167683	4.0	I believe this book will be in my top 3 I have read for the year. It's been awhile since a book completely captivated me and sucked me in so thoroughly that I was sneaking around my house to finish it and avoid my everyday duties. :) No spoilers here as I don't want to ruin the book for anyone.
ba2455719e99ae6e0771877da9e81474	48100	3.0	An interesting twist on the black ops/espionage thriller genres from more of a political point of view. The main character is an attorney working for an off the books group of operators that targets terrorists. The group disbands he is suddenly the fall guy. He scrambles to keep alive and figure out what is happening. A great debut! Interesting perspective from the Department of Justice which is not often seen. Looking forward to more from Chad Boudreaux.
0fc741afbd11cb76f5015d1572542bf6	27423576	5.0	I'm giving this book 4 stars for making me want to stay up late to see what happens, for NO language, and for a gospel presentation in the middle of the book. Way to go, author! The writing wasn't the smoothest and I had a hard time following what was happening, but, that's kind of normal for me with these kinds of books.
0f6a6aa3ee8e5296d843bed2d66f498d	1171422	4.0	This book does everything wrong. The heroine is good-looking (ok, nothing wrong with that), superathletic, supersmart, humble, nice and everything else positive you can think of. Ok, she has low endurance, but that is all. The villains are stereotypes (stupid irrational Arabs), America is great and the solution of the main plot-line is good-looking, superathletic, supersmart, humble... you get it.
8b3596a20a3bc901d87525b9d5426dd2	7932435	2.0	There is such an outrageous amount of flaws contained in Dr. Dahners' Ell Donsaii series that I find it hard to single out specific elements. Here are some of the things I find disappointing:
405965e995cf54fa346c40f611148e7c	342923	5.0	The book is a good read, even though it is all surrealist the way the heroine is litteraly more than human.
